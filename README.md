This repository aims to create a storage for wiki articles that are to be added to the official website. Given today's circumstances, we will not be using an automated method of merging the content - at least for now, we're working on it. If you would like to offer us a hand, please don't hesitate to contact us at [bogazicimun@gmail.com](mailto:bogazicimun@gmail.com).

## How to contribute

Contributions to this wiki is done via pull requests under `wiki` folder. Additions will be checked by our wiki team to ensure that the article fits the quality standards. Upon review, it will be merged to be added to the website later on. 

Articles' going live may take from 1 hour up to 1 week, given that everything else is done manually by a handful people. If an unexpected delay shall occur, please let us know by opening an issue.
